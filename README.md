| **WHEN the value DELIVERY SUCCESS?** |When orders are delivered on time, in full quantity, and meet quality standards. |
| **Northstar Metric Name**  | Delivery Success Rate                              |
| **WHY do you choose this metric?** | This is a composite indicator reflecting the overall efficiency of all three aspects: production (Completion Rate), inventory (Safety Stock Level Rate), and quality (Pass Rate). "Delivery Success Rate" measures the ability to deliver on time, in sufficient quantity, and with assured quality, which is the ultimate goal for all production and supply chain activities. |

## üìä Key Insights & Visualizations  

### üîç Dashboard Preview  

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ View 1: Customer Segmentation Overview  
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f552721-227a-43de-bd02-ce34e9f7a26b)

#### Insights:
- **Completion Rate:** The on-time completion rate is **68.6%**, while **31.4%** of tasks are delayed. This indicates a significant portion of orders need improvement in processing time.
- **Total Produced:** A total production of **4.5 million products** shows stable manufacturing capacity.
- **Total Orders by Subcategory:**  **Wheels and Road Frames** have the highest order volume, with **8.2K** and **6.7K** respectively, indicating high demand for these categories.
- **Product Performance:** Some products, such as **Mountain-100 Black** and **Mountain-500 Black**, have low production costs but could be further optimized by reducing the average production time (currently ranging from **16.9 to 17.8 days**).
#### Recommendations:
- **Improve Completion Rate:** Identify specific causes of delays to enhance production time.
- **Prioritize High-Demand Categories:** Focus on increasing production capacity for **Handlebars** and **Wheels** and consider investing in additional production lines for these items.
- **Reduce Average Production Time:** Evaluate and optimize the production process for products with low costs but long production times.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41e229bb-56f2-41a6-a1de-79dcfd9e8cd0)

#### Insights:
- **Total Inventory**: The current inventory is **339.74K**, with **91.11% being safe products** and **8.89% classified as unsafe products**.
- **Unsafe Products**: There are **95 unsafe products** that require attention to improve quality.
- **Inventory Trend Over Time**: Inventory levels fluctuate significantly, peaking at **48K in December 2014**.
- **Inventory Distribution by Category**: Most inventory is concentrated in **"Components" (49K)**, while categories like **Clothing (-6K)** show negative inventory levels, possibly due to stockouts or management errors.
- **Safe Stocked Products**: Items such as **Adjustable Race** and **BB Ball Bearing** have inventory levels well above the safety threshold.
#### Recommendations:
*a. Reduce Unsafe Products:*
- Identify and address unsafe products in the inventory immediately.
- Analyze the root causes of products becoming unsafe and implement preventive measures.

*b. Adjust Inventory for the Clothing Category:*
- Ensure no negative inventory levels by improving demand forecasting and procurement planning.
- Reassess the actual demand for the Clothing category to avoid overproduction or stock shortages.

*c. Optimize Safe Stocked Products:*
- Redistribute overstocked products (e.g., BB Ball Bearing) to regions or units with higher demand.

#### Insights:
- **Total Scrapped Quantity**: A total of **10.65K products** were scrapped, with **8.87% rejected** due to quality issues.
- **Scrap Trend Over Time**: The number of scrapped products peaked in 2013 (2.2K) and then declined in 2014.
- **Top Scrap Reasons**: The leading causes of scrapping include **"Paint process failed" (1271)**, **"Trim length too long" (981)**, and **"Thermoform temperature issues" (876)**.
- **Defect Rate and Average Production Time**: The defect rate is only **0.24%**, with an average production time of **13.24 days**.
- **Inventory and Scrap Distribution**: Certain products, such as BB Ball Bearing, have high inventory levels but also significant scrap quantities.
#### Recommendations:
*a. Address Common Scrap Reasons:*
- Implement stricter control processes for stages like **painting** and **trimming length**.
- Train employees and monitor temperature standards during thermoforming to reduce thermal issues.

*b. Improve Rejection Rate:*
- Conduct quality checks at critical production stages to detect errors earlier.
- Increase automation in the production process to reduce human-related errors.
